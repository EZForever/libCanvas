# libCanvas #
A tiny library to draw graphics in pure C with Win32 API.

## Why it's there ##
As a former VB fan, I found that controlling forms and draw things on them is much harder in pure C.So I wrote this thing to ease my further tasks.

## Usage ##
```#include <libCanvas.h>```
See `libCanvas.h` and `Demo.c` for more details.

## How to compile ##
Tested with MinGW-w64 on Windows 10.

A Makefile is coming soon, for now you can follow the comments in `Build.h` & `Demo.c`.
